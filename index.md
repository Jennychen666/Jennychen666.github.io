## Welcome to GitHub Pages
The website belongs to Jennychen666, a first-year student in ZJE who loves Bioinformatics.
Here are some instructions and information.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Jennychen666/Jennychen666.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
